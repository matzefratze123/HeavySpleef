What is HeavySpleef?

Spleef is a gamemode in Minecraft where your goal is to knock out players by destroying a floor so the other player falls down.
If a player touches a losezone he is out of the game. Last man standing wins...
With this plugin you can easily setup games without much knowledge.
Just define a cuboid with the built-in selection system or make a cylinder game and add a lobby point and a floor.
After that, the game is ready to play! For more infos how to setup an game click the "Documentation" button on the bukkit-dev site.

Made for Bukkit (Minecraft 1.7.x)
